[Yagss](https://github.com/esonderegger/yagss) (yet another generator for static sites) is a [static site generator](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators). That means it takes a folder full of files in formats that are (hopefully) easier to write and maintain than HTML, CSS, and JS and converts (transpiles) them into a folder full of HTML, CSS, and JS files that can be hosted on a web server, without the need for a dynamic back-end like [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), or [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).
